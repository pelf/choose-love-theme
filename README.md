You'll need to have Node 6.x installed to use the Shopify command line utility tool [Slate](https://shopify.github.io/slate/).

1. Install Slate via NPM
```
npm install -g @shopify/slate
```

2. Clone this repository somewhere
```
git clone git@github.com:ruiramos/choose-love-theme.git
```

3. In the same directory, run
```
slate watch
```
for local template development. More info about building Shopify themes, [start here](https://help.shopify.com/themes/development).

4. Ask me for the project's `config.yml` file so you can connect to the [test store](https://glimpsechooselovetest.myshopify.com/).
